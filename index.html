          <h3>Bio</h3>
           <p>My name is Andrew Mastronardi I am 24 years old and a senior at Eastern Washington University. I am a Spanish Education major about to graduate in the fall of '16. I decided to pursure an education degree in Spanish because im facinated by languages and believe that the more languages one knows the better. There are so many oppoortunites if you know more than one langauge and I hope to be an effective language teacher. I am taking web design because its very interesting and I'm interested on learning how the web works! I also run a small headwear company called Mattan Headwear. You can check out some of my photography and newest hats in the gallery section! </p>
           
           <H3>Proffesional Adjectives</H3>
           <p>One day I hope to be a high school spanish teacher or an English teacher abroad in other countries.</p>

 <h3>Extra</h3>
 
 <p>I hope to one day to learn and aquire more skills in many different other softwares as well as web design. I am extremely hard working and am facinated by the way the web works. The idea that the web is constantly changing is facinating to me and exciting at the same time because it opens the door for so much innovation in the future.  </p>
